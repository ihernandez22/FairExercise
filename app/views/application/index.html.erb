  <p>This is Isaac Hernandez's response to Fair.com's interview technical test. The README of the Github repository on <%= link_to "https://github.com/ihernandez22/FairExercise" %> has details on how to access and use the JSON API (through a rails console). The front end part of this project is pretty straightforward.</p>
  <p>You can start by going to the Credit Cards page where you can create and view credit cards. I recommend using December 1, 2017 as the "Current Period Payment Start Date". It will be easy to add a transaction as the 15th day, because that would simply be December 15, 2017. The payment period must have also ended in order to access the "Close Payment Period" feature (so the payment period start date must be 30 days before today to access that feature).</p>
  <p>Once a credit card is created, you can click on it to view the credit card's information. This section also has a feature to create transactions. You may create as many transactions as you'd like.</p>
  <p>If today is your credit card's Current Payment Period End Date, or that day has passed you can close out the payment period (as explained above). An interest charge will be created if applicable.</p>
  <p> Steps to recreate Test Case 1 from the <%= link_to "spec", "https://github.com/wearefair/interview/tree/master/engineering" %>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a credit card with the default start date.</li>
  <li>Create a draw transaction on November 30, 2017 (11/30/2017) for $500.00.</li>
  <li>Close the payment period.</li>
</ul>
